<p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">In a post Google&nbsp;Penguin&nbsp;and Panda era more attention need to be given to quality of links rather then&nbsp;quantity. One link to your site&nbsp;coming&nbsp;from quality article on a reputable site could improve&nbsp;your&nbsp;ranking better then 1000 low quality links&nbsp;coming&nbsp;from unknown or bad&nbsp;neighbourhoods.

<p>Our policy is to be honest and transparent to our&nbsp;potential&nbsp;and&nbsp;existing&nbsp;clients.

The answer is...it just depends! We will give you an estimate based on our experience within first month after start you SEO&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;when we see how Google reacts to your site and our optimization, but it is never an exact science.</p>
